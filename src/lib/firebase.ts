// This file is intentionally left blank or removed as part of reverting Firebase Authentication.
// If you need Firebase for other services (like Firestore, Storage), you would reconfigure this
// but without the auth-specific parts if auth is handled differently.
// For now, reverting means this configuration is no longer needed for client-side auth.
